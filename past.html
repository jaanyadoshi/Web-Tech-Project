          Football (soccer) is one of the most popular sports in India. The game
          is played extensively in the country, with the maximum fan following
          in Goa, Kerala, West Bengal, Mizoram, Manipur and Sikkim. In the rest
          of the states, it is next to cricket in terms of popularity. All the
          international league matches and the soccer World Cup are keenly
          watched by the sports enthusiasts in the sub continent. The game holds
          a rich tradition in India, its history being something that deserves
          special mention. Go through the following lines to get information on
          the history of football in India.

          Women's football in India was administered by the Women's Football
          Federation of India (WFFI) until early 1990s, when the AIFF took over
          the administration of women's soccer in the country. Just like the
          men's game, the women's game had its early pioneers from the state of
          West Bengal. The women's clubs were started by East Bengal and Mohun
          Bagan clubs in 2000-01 season. National championships for both senior
          and junior girls are also held. The majority of players in the Indian
          women's national football team are from Manipur and West Bengal.
          However, women's football in India has not gained as much popularity
          as the men's teams have.

          There are numerous challenges on the path to engaging women and girls
          in Football. One of the biggest setbacks faced in South Asian
          countries like India, especially in the more rural areas where
          football is very popular, is that women and girls are viewed as
          ‘homemakers’ and this role is thrust upon them as being their
          obligation, not a choice. This has led these women and girls
          themselves having reservations with regard to failing society and
          their own families by not doing their duty and daring to step outside
          of their clearly defined ‘role’.
        </td>
        <td>
          Sexual harassment and lack of safe spaces is yet another problem faced
          by girls and women playing football. For instance “girls playing
          football in the Mathare Youth Sports Association (MYSA) programme in
          Kenya spoke of the taunts and jeers of the boys who teased them as
          they walked in the community and of the risk of being harassed by
          street boys who were present near the playing field.” Some of these
          girls and women are subjected to domestic violence due to daring to
          step out of their stereotypical roles of ‘mother’ or ‘daughter’ or
          both. “...one of the girls in the MYSA programme noted, “When I
          started playing for MYSA my father would say that there is no football
          for girls, and he would beat me up.
