    <h1>My Soccer Journey</h1>
    <strong>'Good things come in small packages’....Well, not always!</strong>

    <p id="p1">
      Usain bolt said, “I know what I can do, so I never doubt myself.” This
      epitomizes my belief. I come from a typical stereo-typical Indian
      community where obesity is perceived as a huge negative. People have
      confirmed their opinions that fat is ugly and thin is gorgeous. Fat is
      unfit and thin is fit. Indian society believes that if fat people really
      wanted to they could just lose weight and permanently be thin. Fat is not
      the problem; instead, fat oppression endorsed and then further strongly
      reinforced by society is the problem. Society has distinctly separated fat
      and thin into a strict chasm. Often this worried me. My weight has been a
      huge concern. It is the opinion of some people who belong to an old school
      of thinking that obesity and sports cannot go hand in hand but it did with
      me. They still question my skill and drive for following my passion simply
      because they believe it is not possible. My interest in football sparked
      at a very young age. Although I would sign up for tryouts I was never
      called. The reason being my obesity, a fixated belief that obese children
      display complacency and tardiness, which is far from what is associated
      with the sports industry. I was crestfallen as I was judged without a fair
      verdict. With my parents’ constantly encouragement to follow my passion
      and dream, one morning I decided to turn up at the tryouts. My coach
      wasn’t really convinced but decided to give me a chance only because I was
      on the field. He was confident that I wouldn’t save even a single goal. A
      goalkeeper is supposed to be agile, quick, vigilant and having quick
      reflexes and fitness is supposed to be prime criteria. Clearly I did not
      match that physically. But I was nursing a secret dream, which was
      certainly not ending before I even started pursuing it. I was here to
      stay. Obesity should not be a criterion to diminish one's dreams. The
      match began and before anyone could even think I plunged into action and
      made the first ‘unexpected’ save. A hard dive and I pushed the ball
      outside. Not only did I leave my coach jaw-dropped, but I also had the
      other ‘thin and fit’ goalkeepers shocked. This try-out was the beginning
      of my football journey. Currently, it is my 6th year on the school team,
      and I have managed to retain my position year after year owing to my hard
      work and blessings of my parents. I have proved myself to other ‘thin’
      keepers who thought that I was no competition at all because all I could
      do was ‘cover half of the goal’.

      Since then, my team has won more than 5 tournaments and won innumerable
      runners up and third place trophies. Out of all our wins, most of them
      have been won in penalties where I was assigned to play as the keeper.
      Making my team proud in several tournaments such as the Dhirubhai Ambani
      tournament and district tournaments such as DSO and MSSA, have motivated
      me to accomplish my once ‘impossible’ and ‘wildest’ dreams. Headlining in
      the newspaper which spoke about how I played during the MSSA Final’s
      penalties, was a sheer delight and a moment of pride for my entire team,
      my family and more importantly, myself. Opening the sports section in the
      newspaper and reading “Keeper Jaanya Doshi shines for Hill Spring”,
      reinforced my confidence. Winning not only MSSA but also other tournaments
      in penalties made me realize what an important asset I am to the team,
      which I never fathomed would happen. To date, when my coach tells me,
      there is a new keeper, I still get butterflies in my stomach before
      attending tryouts. However, I walk on the field with self- belief and
      faith that the outcome will be for the best.
