          >One of the easiest ways to support women’s soccer is to watch. That’s
          right, simply clicking on your TV and tuning in helps the sport grow.
          Watching shows media channels that there is a demand for the sport. It
          is an incredibly simple way to show your support and move the needle
          for change. Of course, tune in to the big games, like the World Cup
          and NWSL final. But take it a step further. Watch other games. Pick a
          few teams to follow and root for. Be a consistent supporter.

          get out there and watch in person! If you have a local professional
          team, then definitely go to at least one home game. You can also head
          to a local college game at any level. As a professional player, I can
          tell you that this kind of support goes a long way. It’s encouraging
          and empowering to see people in the stands and hear the crowd ebb and
          flow with the game. This is a great way to support players, and it
          also supports the sport. Again, it shows interest and contributes
          financially (however small).
