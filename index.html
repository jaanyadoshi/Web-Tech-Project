    <p id="p1">
      Sports is a multi-faceted activity leading to a myriad of benefits which
      extend far beyond physical development and health advantages. It leads to
      development of leadership and team work skills, especially in the case of
      team sports, increases communication, negotiation and coping skills. As
      such, in recent times, there has been an increased interest in sports by
      both the development sector as well as the corporate world. Sports is
      indeed unique in that it has been able to create an overlap in two
      otherwise very separate worlds. The development sector appreciating it for
      its potential use as a powerful developmental tool and the Corporate world
      seeing it as a powerful economic propellant.
